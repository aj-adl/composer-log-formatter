# composer-log-formatter

A quick and dirty log formatter based on the stock nuxt project boilerplate and some regex.

*Things it does:*
- Gets shit done.

*Things it doesn't to:*
- Adhere to any coding standard

## Using

Build locally or visit the above link. Copy & paste the output from `composer update` in and watch the magic happen.

## Caveats

Totally set up to work with how we do things at Frame Creative - if anyone else uses this, just fork it and change the conditions in `LogInput.vue`'s computed properties so it works for you and your package repositories of choice.
